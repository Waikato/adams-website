ADAMS is the base platform for most of our projects, research or commercial.
For instance, we have expertise in developing frameworks and applications for
processing instrument data on a large scale, such as `near infrared
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Infrared>`_ (NIR) and
`gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry>`_
(GC-MS; see also `publications </publications>`_).

If you have a machine learning or data mining problem that requires solving and you would like to draw on our expertise, please feel free to contact **Peter Reutemann**:
