Please choose a section of examples:

* `Basic <link://slug/users-examples-basic>`_
* `Visualization <link://slug/users-examples-visualization>`_
* `Time series <link://slug/users-examples-timeseries>`_

* `Other <link://slug/users-examples-other>`_

**Note:** the videos should only be considered educational, as some of the
concepts in ADAMS have changed over time. E.g., *global* actors are now called
*callable*, since they can appear in different scopes within the flow. Also,
*SingleFileSupplier* and *MultiFileSupplier* got merged into the *FileSupplier*
actor.
