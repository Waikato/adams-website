`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ is a great way of deploying applications
for processing data, running webservices, etc., all nicely containerized.
Java applications can be packaged with Docker as well and ADAMS is no exceptions.

Pre-built images
----------------

Once a week, our build server pushes out the current snapshots out to the public
Docker Hub registry, so you do not have to do this. These images are built
on top of an Ubuntu Linux distribution, with ADAMS installed from the Debian 
packages that also get generated by our build server.

These pre-built docker images are avilable from the following location:

`hub.docker.com/u/theadamsflow/ <https://hub.docker.com/u/theadamsflow>`__

For running the latest *adams-ml-app*, you first have to pull the image:

.. code::

   docker pull theadamsflow/adams-ml-app:latest

If not already done in the current session, you need to expose your xhost in
order to allow the Docker container to display the ADAMS user interface using 
your local X-Server:

.. code::

   xhost +local:root

Spin up a container from this image with this command:

.. code::

   docker run -it --env="DISPLAY" --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" theadamsflow/adams-ml-app:latest

Now you can start up the user interface from the console using:

.. code::

   adams-ml-app-gui

Once you have closed ADAMS, you can exit the container with the *exit*
(*Ctrl+D*) command.


**NB:** These instructions assume that you have docker installed on your
Linux machine. See the `MOA blog post <https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/how-to-use-moa-in-docker/>`__
for details on getting the X-Server working on Windows and Mac OSX.


Custom images
-------------

However, these pre-built base images may not suit your needs, as they may
be to large or lacking functionality that you need. If you want to 
containerize a single worker flow, then you can have a look at the
*adamsflow2docker* library:

`github.com/waikato-datamining/adamsflow2docker <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adamsflow2docker>`__

This project generates a *Dockerfile* from a list of ADAMS modules (and 
version) that should make up the application and executes the specified
flow inside the image using the *adams.flow.FlowRunner* class.
