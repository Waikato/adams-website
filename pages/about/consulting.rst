ADAMS is the base platform for most of our projects, research or commercial.
For instance, we have expertise in developing frameworks and applications for
processing instrument data on a large scale, such as `near infrared <NIR_>`_
(NIR), `gas chromatography-mass spectrometry <GCMS_>`_ (GC-MS; see also
`publications <link://slug/publications>`_) and image processing.

If you have a machine learning or data mining problem that requires solving and
you would like to draw on our expertise, please feel free to contact **Peter
Reutemann**:
