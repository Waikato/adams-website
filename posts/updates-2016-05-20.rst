A major change in versioning of the artifacts has occurred: from now on, 
artifacts will have *YY.MM.x* as version, with *YY* being the year, 
*MM* the month and *x* the release in that month, starting with 0. This
makes it a bit easier tracking down from what time period a snapshot is.


**Fixes**

* *adams-weka:* The *WekaExtractArray* transformer now uses the correct
  maximum for columns/rows in case of spreadsheets (was accidentally swapped).
* *Default* timezone no longer results in using GMT but the system-defined
  one. Java's timezone uses GMT if a timezone string cannot be parsed.


**Changes**

* *adams-core:* 

  * The *Injector* control actor can replace tokens passing through
    now, not just adding them before or after. Furthermore, it can also inject
    data from storage now.
  * The *TrainableBatchFilter* interface is used by transformers derived
    from *AbstractFilter* to train them if necessary with the first batch
    of data. Such filters can be reset with the monitor variable of the
    transformer.

* *adams-weka:* upgraded multisearch-weka-package to 2016.5.15, which fixes
  a multithreading bug
* Moved the following modules from *base* to *addons*:

  * gnuplot
  * latex
  * maps
  * moa
  * osm
  * r
  * random
  * twitter


**Additions**

* *adams-spreadsheet:* It is now possible to extract columns or rows from
  a spreadsheet by using the *SpreadSheetExtractArray* transformer.
* Added new addons module *adams-dl4j*, which makes the deeplearning4j
  library available within ADAMS.
