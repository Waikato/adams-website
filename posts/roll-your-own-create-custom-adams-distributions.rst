With the launch of the new ADAMS homepage, I also added a new feature, 
called "roll your own". This functionality allows you to create custom 
ADAMS distributions based on your selection of ADAMS release and 
modules. What you basically do is create a custom Maven build file 
("pom.xml") and use that to build the custom distribution. 

You can find this feature here:
