Finally came across a migration guide (subversion to git), one that actually worked:

`https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git>`__

Main issue with the migration was the sub-division of the repository into base/addons/incubator/etc.
However, I decided to skip really old code and just start at a revision *after* the sub-division.

You can find the repositories now here:

* `https://github.com/Waikato/adams-base <https://github.com/Waikato/adams-base>`__
* `https://github.com/Waikato/adams-addons <https://github.com/Waikato/adams-addons>`__
* `https://github.com/Waikato/adams-incubator <https://github.com/Waikato/adams-incubator>`__
* `https://github.com/Waikato/adams-libraries <https://github.com/Waikato/adams-libraries>`__
* `https://github.com/Waikato/adams-spectral-base <https://github.com/Waikato/adams-spectral-base>`__
* `https://github.com/Waikato/adams-applications <https://github.com/Waikato/adams-applications>`__

Contributing should be much easier now, so go on, fork the repos! :-)
