Just a heads up that the build system 
(https://adams.cms.waikato.ac.nz/jenkins/) has switched to Java 8. 
Some reference files for the regression tests needed to be updated 
during that process. 

Currently, the code base is still Java 7 and it still compiles to 7. 
However, this might change in the future without further notice. 

Why? Java 7 will reach its end-of-life in April this year.
