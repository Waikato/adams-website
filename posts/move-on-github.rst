Apologies, the ADAMS repositories have moved again, but only from one GitHub organization
to another. This was done mainly to align the repositories with our commercial activity.
The organization account on GitHub is called `waikato-datamining <https://github.com/waikato-datamining>`__.

You can find the relocated repositories now here:

* `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-base <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-base>`__
* `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-addons <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-addons>`__
* `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-incubator <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-incubator>`__
* `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-libraries <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-libraries>`__
* `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-spectral-base <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-spectral-base>`__
* `https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-applications <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/adams-applications>`__

Don't worry, if you have already cloned the repository, you can simply update the URL in the 
*.git/config* file from:

``url = https://github.com/Waikato/<repo>.git``

to:

``url = https://github.com/waikato-datamining/<repo>.git``
