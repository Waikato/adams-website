I can't remember exactly when I started using Eclipse as an IDE for developing Java applications, but it's been a while probably dating back to at least version 3.2 (released in 2006). However, in recent years I've become more and more annoyed by its random and sometimes outright weird behavior: sudden shutdowns, restart required for errors to go away (clean all projects didn't do it), ...

Since I started dabbling in Python last year (https://github.com/fracpete/python-weka-wrapper), I was on the lookout for an nice IDE and finally settled on PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

Being rather happy with it, I decided this year, after some initial preparations in December, to finally jump ship and use IntelliJ IDEA (community edition - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
