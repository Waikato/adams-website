Up till now, the ADAMS website was very much static and a hand-crafted
bootstrap3-based one. However, this has changed now and I switched
to a Nikola powered one.

`Nikola <https://getnikola.com/>`_ is a static site generator written in 
Python. As it uses plain text files as input, like `reStructured Text
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/>`_ or `Markdown
<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_, and converts these 
into HTML using themes, it allows you to concentrate on the content rather 
than having to worry about any manually crafting HTML code.
